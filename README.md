# How long have you been working on this project?
~3 hours, I hope to spend even more time on it to get a lot done.

# What is voxel?
Voxel is a very simple voxel engine written entirely in OpenGL. It's going to be an open source game engine. 

# What have I done so far?
Well, its just a really simple voxel engine. More is to come, however as of now, it just generates a block mesh. It doesn't even have textures! Just solid colors!

# How "fast" and "big" is voxel?
As of now, my algorithims, rendering techinques, and other things like that are horrid. I hope to fix it. It uses somewhat deprecated OpenGL. In the next week however, I should have a lot done! 

# Setting up
1. Go download GLEW and SDL 2.0 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.0.0/glew-2.0.0-win32.zip/download, http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip, please use whatever version of windows / linux / mac / whatever)
2. Include the directories to your project, also make sure you add the the libraries or you'll get link errors!
3. Run the code, and bam! You're done!

# Credits
Matt Hopson: Thanks for making this with me! It means a lot.
